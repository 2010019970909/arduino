# Nicolas Kruchten's Arduino Sketchbook

This is my entire Arduino sketchbook. Various folders contain the code for projects I post about on my blog at http://nicolas.kruchten.com

Code in this repo can be used under an MIT-style license, except as otherwise indicated in the source itself, as in the /libraries directory, as much of that code comes from others.
