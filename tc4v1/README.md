# Temperature monitor for Rancilio Silvia

This sketch was used to monitor the temperature of my espresso machine, and reports its findings over a serial connection to a computer. See [this blog post](http://nicolas.kruchten.com/content/2011/04/graphing-siliva-temperature-on-ipad/) for an explanation and [this repo](https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/coffeegraph) for the code that ran on the computer.
